The Statistics Canada Library is happy to invite you to a virtual presentation that will highlight how you can access historic Statistics Canada data. <!--more-->

In this presentation, you’ll learn:
 - How to use the Statistics Canada Library’s catalogue
 - How to search the historical catalogue to find the information you need
 - How to navigate the Historical Resources InfoGuide

Please note that this presentation will help you find published data, not raw data. In addition, this session is geared towards beginners or those who would like a refresher with published non-census data.
