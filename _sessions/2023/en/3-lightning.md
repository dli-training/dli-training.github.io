## Lightning Talks

### Data Literacy in \[insert time here\] Minutes

> Julie Marcoux (Dalhousie University)

Be terrified by some spooky data headlines, dazed by the many dimensions of data, informed by data literacy definitions and frameworks, amazed by interesting examples, and (maybe) feel more ready to explain data literacy to your colleagues as a result of watching this lightning-fast talk.

### Harnessing the “Power From Data!”

> Alparslan Ozturk (Carleton University)

Understanding data can be difficult and learning how to do so can be intimidating. Yet data analysis is a vital component in the researcher's toolkit. In parallel, for data specialists and librarians, it can also be difficult to decide, and easy to get lost, when determining where to start  teaching the fundamentals of data analysis. Thankfully, we can now use Statistics Canada's "Power From Data!". This lightning talk will describe what information is available on "Statistics: Power From Data!", and how it can be an effective tool in helping teach data analysis.

### Speed Through Excel's Flash Fill Feature

> Julie Marcoux (Dalhousie University)

Do you know about DGUIDs? Have you ever used Excel's Flash Fill feature? Have you ever thought of combining DGUIDs and Excel's Flash Fill? Did you know that you can view the same Excel file in two different windows at the same time? Is that too many questions??? Learn about Flash Fills in Excel using an example relevant to the DLI community, and also be amazed by an incredibly easy trick in Excel - that also works in Microsoft Word - that seemingly no one knows about!

### Updates from the Access-Limited Data Discovery Working Group

> Sarah Rutley and Kevin Read (University of Saskatchewan)

This presentation provides an update on the activities of the Alliance's Access-Limited Data Discovery Working Group, which was formed in 2020 to investigate the discoverability and accessibility of limited- and restricted- access data in Canada. At DLI National Training in 2021 we shared our progress and gathered feedback on our work scoping the landscape of access-limited data, and we now share findings from the final phase of our work which focused on understanding and improving metadata for restricted-access data. During this phase we identified common ways that restricted data sources describe their data holdings and access procedures, evaluated how well existing metadata schemas support this information, and developed recommendations for making restricted-access data more FAIR.
