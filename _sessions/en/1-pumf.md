This panel will discuss providing access and facilitating access to Statistics Canada data along the continuum of data access. <!--more-->

The panel will have representatives from the DLI Community, \<odesi\>, researchers, Real Time Remote Access system (RTRA), Virtual Data Lab (vDL), and the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN).

## Real Time Remote Access

The RTRA system is an on-line remote access facility allowing users to run SAS programs, in real-time, against microdata located in a central and secure location.

## Virtual Data Lab

The Virtual Data Lab (vDL) is a new mode on the continuum of access that builds on the foundation of the Research Data Centres (RDCs) and the Canadian Centre for Data Development and Economic Research (CDER). In its end state, the vDL will provide remote access to detailed anonymized social and business microdata for research and analysis through a secure cloud-based interface. After Statistics Canada tested various prototypes, the project team is now launching pilots for external partners to test the vDL environment. With the lessons learned from these pilots, the team will continue to improve the environment until its launch in 2021.

This panel will be presented in a bilingual format and copies of the presentation materials will be available in both English and French prior to the presentations.
