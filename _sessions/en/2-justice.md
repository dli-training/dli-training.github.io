Understanding how to exploit the research potential of the data sets produced by the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety can contribute in a significant manner in the development of crime prevention programs, and are instrumental in developing evidence-based policy. The presentation will discuss how to exploit police and courts administrative records as well as new surveys related to gender based violence.
