Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the Centre for Social Data Integration and Development (CSDID) team, in conjunction with various partners, has conducted 8 crowdsource surveys targeting the general population, parents, students and persons living with disabilities.<!--more-->

We have also conducted 6 iterations of the Canadian Perspectives Series, a web panel experiment and have been diligently producing PUMFs for all these projects. Kathleen Fowler and Melanie Kowalski from CSDID will walk us through the highlights of the COVID-19 data projects focusing on the methodology of collection tools used, results and dissemination products produced from this initiative.
