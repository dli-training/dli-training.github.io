Due to the pandemic, our normal teaching routines were disrupted. We were forced to adapt and change our approaches by teaching our workshops on data literacy and tools from in-person to a completely online environment. <!--more-->

Panel speakers will discuss our different approaches to this task, what has worked, and what challenges we’ve faced. We’ll leave time for discussion and for others to share their own instruction experiences in this unusual year.
