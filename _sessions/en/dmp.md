This will be an applied session focused upon Data Management Plans. Topics covered will include the importance and benefits of DMPs, how they can support research projects, what makes a ‘good’ DMP, as well as an in-depth look at their content. A hands-on demonstration of the freely available Portage Data Management Planning (DMP) Assistant will be offered, and participants are welcome to create an account prior to the session should they wish to learn to navigate and use this gold standard data management planning tool. Additionally, resources to help guide the development of DMPs, including guidance documents and Exemplar DMPs - will be provided!
