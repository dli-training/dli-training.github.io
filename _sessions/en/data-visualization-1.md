This self-paced online course will introduce participants to a common data visualization tool, Tableau Desktop. Participants will learn to create a variety of visualizations such as a line graph of profits over time by product category, a box plot of iris petal widths by species, and a stacked bar graph of word frequencies in Romeo and Juliet.
