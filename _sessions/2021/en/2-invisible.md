A sustainable data culture is also an inclusive data culture where planning, policy making, and research accounts for marginalized or underrepresented populations. Indigenous Peoples, racialized groups, and people who identify as LGBTQ+ are often underrepresented or hidden in the datasets we rely on for research and planning. Data about mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness can likewise be difficult to find, particularly for marginalized populations.<!--more-->

To move toward a more sustainable and inclusive data culture we need to understand the historical and social context for this lack of visibility and the impact it can have in the present. It is also important to share this understanding with researchers, making them aware of potential gaps in the data, the reasons for those gaps, and alternative sources of information about marginalized groups or topics.

This presentation explores the relative invisibility of several populations in the Canadian data context. We identify specific issues that contribute to these gaps including historical decisions about the Census; relationships between Indigenous Peoples and colonizing cultures; mainstream perceptions that sideline some subjects; and barriers to collecting data about certain groups or topics. The presenters draw on examples primarily from the Canadian context with occasional comparison to other international jurisdictions. In Fall 2019 and Winter 2020, two data librarians at different universities in Canada collaborated on a series of data literacy workshops about how to find data on marginalized or underrepresented populations. They will also report back on the experience of teaching these topics with their university communities and share the outcome and opportunities for providing instruction with more inclusive data sources.
