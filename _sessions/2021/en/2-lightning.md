# Pre-recorded Lightning Talks


#### [Being a data juggler - Jane Fry, Carleton University](https://youtu.be/mgUr4meSERo)   
- With so many us of wearing more than one hat, it is a challenge to keep all these balls in the air. So I would like to offer some practical suggestions from an experienced juggler – not to say that I don’t ever drop the ball myself!

#### [Who is counted? How to use the Census of Canada timeline to search for ethno-racial and Indigenous identities - Kevin Manuel, Ryerson University; Rosa Orlandini, York University](https://youtu.be/DU67nc_pJo8)  
- Finding data on race, racialized populations, and anti-racism in Canada can be a complex process when conducting research. One source of data is the Census of Canada which has been collecting socio-demographic data since 1871. However, the collection of racial, ethnic, or Indigenous data has changed throughout the years and from Census to Census. This video provides an overview of the Census Timeline guide, how questions about ethno-racial and Indigenous identity have been asked over time, and some of the challenges with searching for ethno-racial data.

#### [Dataverse and metadata curation guides: An introduction - Alexandra Cooper, Queen’s University; Mark Goodwin, UBC](https://youtu.be/Hb7SaesOMSc)  
- This video will introduce you to the new Dataverse Curation Guide and Dataverse North Metadata Best Practices Guide. Used together, the guides provide both a novice and experienced Dataverse user support in depositing their data into Dataverse. The guides were authored by the Dataverse Curation Working Group and the Dataverse North Metadata Working Group, both part of the Alliance RDM.

#### [How to make short instructional videos for YouTube (without narrating them yourself! - Sandra Sawchuk, Mount Saint Vincent University)](https://youtu.be/Bz6TwChfSe4)  
- Tutorial videos are becoming increasingly popular, as they allow viewers to learn at their own pace and rewatch content as many times as they need. These videos are indispensable for supplementing classroom instruction, but they are labour-intensive and they can become outdated very quickly. This lightning talk describes a streamlined method for creating tutorial videos that uses text-to-voice narration recorded from a single transcript. The transcript is also used for subtitles, which enhances accessibility, while reducing the overall time spent on content creation. For a sample of this method, see this video: [Statistics Canada - Finding and Adjusting Tables](https://youtu.be/A5l5Pvkca8A). For now, this tutorial is only available for Mac users, though a tutorial for PC is forthcoming.
