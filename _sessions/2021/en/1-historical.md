This presentation seeks to build on the in-depth, collective expertise of the DLI community, and will also provide a brief update on the project.  As key stakeholders implicated in the proposed Canadian Census data discovery portal, this DLI community discussion will provide valuable insights across a range of structured questions about what makes for good Census data discovery. <!--more-->

Thanks to the knowledge of the DLI community in terms of Census end-users, Census data and documentation, together with their access portals and uses, the feedback from this presentation will make a valuable contribution to the project and will help guide the development of Canadian Census data discovery portal proof-of concept.
