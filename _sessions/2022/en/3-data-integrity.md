We often talk about making data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), but what about data accuracy, reliability, and consistency?<!--more-->

Research data are constantly being moved through stages of collection, storage, transfer, archiving, and destruction. This movement comes at a cost, as files stored or transferred incorrectly may be unusable or incomplete. This session will cover the basics of data integrity, from collection to validation. It will also introduce the [Damage tool](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/fcheck/), a utility which creates file manifests in a variety of formats. We will draw on real-world examples to illustrate how Damage could be used in the DLI program to assure the integrity of downloaded files and to identify and fix issues in DLI-distributed data.
