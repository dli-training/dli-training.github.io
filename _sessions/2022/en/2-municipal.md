Most public decisions that shape the fundamental character of our way of life are made at the municipal level. From large urban cities to smaller, rural or agricultural areas, municipal data helps us understand our local environment, identify variations between regions and drives local policy. <!--more-->

Statistics Canada is committed to providing detailed statistics to municipalities and other stakeholders, including academic institutions, by improving access to municipal-level and disaggregate data, and establishing greater data-sharing and collaboration. This presentation provides an overview of the municipal data program to help set the stage for how Statistics Canada can better work with academic institutions to advance these efforts.
