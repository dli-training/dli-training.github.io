Since the launch of ODESI in 2008, academic libraries have supported the development of shared infrastructure for open discovery and access to important collections of Canadian social science survey data. <!--more-->

With the current migration of all metadata and data collections to the new national Borealis data repository, collaborative curation and best practices are migrating as well, leading to the development of new approaches, training, policies, and documentation, to support the ongoing deposit, curation, and preservation of data in the repository. This presentation will provide an overview of the repository migration project, updates to the search interface to support further integration with Borealis, and steps taken by the technical team and community-led committee to ensure a smooth transition for all ODESI end-users and library data stewards.
