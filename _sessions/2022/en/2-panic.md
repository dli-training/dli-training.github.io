In the early 2000s, DLI-affiliated librarians created a repository to provide access to training materials created by and for the data community as a means of supporting knowledge transfer and dissemination. The repository has moved twice already in its 20-year lifespan, but it now needs to be moved again. <!--more-->

Best practices in metadata for discovery have changed dramatically over the last few decades, something that is readily apparent when searching the collection. After consultation with the DLI data community, it was determined that there was a desire not only for improved description, but for curated learning trajectories designed to support independent learning and development of data literacy skills.

This presentation will cover the progress and challenges of moving the DLI Training Repository. There will be a preview of the repository in its new home, Borealis.
