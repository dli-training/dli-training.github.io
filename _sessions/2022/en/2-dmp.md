This session offers participants an overview of the current status of data management plans (DMPs) in Canada, including requirements that are being set forth by the Tri-Agency as well as support available to stakeholders by way of resources and  services. <!--more-->

Foundational information regarding the importance and benefits of DMPs, a general overview of their content, how they can support research projects, and what makes a ‘good’ DMP will be provided. A virtual tour of the freely available DMP Assistant service platform will be offered, including how to access and use it, its key features, and a glimpse into its future developments. Additionally, a range of freely available resources developed by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s DMP Expert Group (DMPEG) will be highlighted, including those that assist with guiding the development of DMPs, along with DMP templates and exemplars. A DMP assessment rubric that is currently in development, as well as future areas of focus of DMPEG, will additionally be discussed.
