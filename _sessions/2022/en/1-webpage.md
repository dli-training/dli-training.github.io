Have you ever asked yourself the question - where do I find that on the StatCan website? We have many times, and more often than not we are stumped when we try to find an excellent resource we have seen before, but we simply cannot find it quickly enough when we need it, if at all. <!--more-->

This presentation will show you some helpful data resources we have found to answer the requests we all get regularly. There are data hubs, annual resources, infographics, data bytes, data portals, … that we have found and have put together on a webpage to share with you. Come and check out our discoveries so you won’t have to reinvent the wheel!
