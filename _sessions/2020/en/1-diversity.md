The Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics Hub focuses on disaggregated data by gender and other identities to support evidence-based policy development and decision making. <!--more-->

The hub is a centralized platform that enables users to easily access and analyze a wealth of statistical information, relevant to the evaluation of programs, policies and initiatives from a gender, diversity and inclusion perspective.

The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate how to access the hub and to provide a description of the hub’s functionalities. This presentation will also touch on the history of the hub, future development plans for the hub, and other Statistics Canada’s hubs on diverse populations.
