This session introduces three comparative research databases: the Employment Standards Database (ESD), the Comparative Perspectives on Precarious Employment Database (CPD), and the Gender and Work Database (GWD). <!--more-->

Each database harmonizes information from national and cross-national surveys, and is supported by a library, thesaurus, harmonized codebook and instructional/demonstration modules.
