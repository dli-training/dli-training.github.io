"The impact of the DLI on the development of the professional roles of data specialist, data librarian in Canadian academic institutions is profound. This relationship is nearly 30 years strong, and the network of professionals that are either providing data reference, data services or Research Data Management services at Canadian academic institutions have often benefited from training within the DLI program, or membership in the Canadian data community.<!--more-->

The presenters have supported the DLI at their institutions since 2003, 2001 and 1998, and have also held leadership roles within the DLI Professional Development Committee. In 2018 an IASSIST presentation examined the impact of the DLI program on this community by referencing topics of training, regional and national training programs as well as journal articles and other publications.

The presenters will share their ongoing updated work revisiting the 2018 IASSIST presentation. We will share our preliminary findings and anticipated output from a broad literature review, survey and interviews on the DLI program, training, the need for professional development of data specialists / librarians, as well as how those in these roles have expanded their scope to support other data needs including RDM."
