Are you a data enthusiast? Do you like the opinions of the public? Did you know of all the Public Opinion Polls (POPs) that are open to the world and are available in Odesi? These POPs from various government departments, Gallup Canada, International Social Survey Programme (and more!) have been rescued and preserved by Carleton University. <!--more-->You can either download the microdata or simply view your analyses in a table, without having to know a stats analysis software. You will learn which polls are available and how to access and use them; and then you will be able to scrutinise them for yourself and/or recommend them to your friends, family, colleagues, and researchers!
